We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of members in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Culture

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.

## Vendors

Microsoft and other vendors are NOT here in an official capacity. Any advice given by Microsoft or other tagged vendors isn’t official support and should be taken as-is. For professional assistance, use the vendors appropriate support channel such as Microsoft’s support.microsoft.com. However, we do offer a "Trusted Vendor" role, along with numerous sub-roles for specific vendors, if you are an official vendor representative. If you are interested in obtaining this role, please send a direct message to the [WinAdmins Twitter account](https://twitter.com/winadmins) and the admin team will follow up with you.

## Logs & Records

Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public. We cannot prevent people from screen-shotting or otherwise logging chat. We also can’t guarantee that every member’s login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

## Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment based on race, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or age
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or engage in self-harm
- Deliberate intimidation
- Sustained disruption of discussion
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- Publication of non-harassing private communication (except where necessary to report harassment)

## Remote Access

Requesting remote access or offering remote access to others to resolve issues, or for any other purpose, is - strictly forbidden. While it may seem helpful, the potential for harm is too high.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a moderator or admin via Discord DM, or utilize the `-callmods` command in the channel where it occurred. They’ll respond as promptly as they can.

This code of conduct applies to all members, but if you are being harassed by a member of WinAdmins, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by WinAdmins members, especially the administrators, extremely seriously. The admin team reserves the right to exclude people from WinAdmins based on their past behavior, including behavior outside WinAdmins and behavior towards people who are not members.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of WinAdmins members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the moderators and admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this server and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we’ve received complaints. As part of tracking problem users moderators and admins will issue warnings.

If you have been banned and would like to appeal it, please send an email to admins@winadmins.io, and a community administrator will follow up with you. Not all ban appeals are guaranteed to be actioned, but we will look into them.
