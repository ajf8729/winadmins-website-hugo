## Who are the WinAdmins?

The WinAdmins are a collection of IT professionals focused on enterprise administration of Microsoft-based environments, interested in information sharing through online chat, blogs, tweets, and conferences/meetups. We are, in short, a loosely formed community focused on helping others in managing IT environments. While our original focus was on the management of Microsoft Windows environments, we’ve grown to support each other in managing Mac, Mobile, Cloud, and all new emerging technologies.

## Becoming a Member

WinAdmins is a loosely formed organization – there is currently no official membership. You can find our community in our online chat room and you can find many of our resources on this website. If you’re looking for help, come ask for it; someone has probably been down your road before. If you’re looking to help or mentor, come offer it. If there’s something specific you’d like to contribute, please reach out to the organizers.

## Contacting Staff

If you have a need to reach out to staff directly with anything, feel free to DM an online staff member, or send an email to admins@winadmins.io to collectively reach the Admin team as a whole.
