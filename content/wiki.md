Title: "Wiki"
Description: "WinAdmins Community Wiki"
---

The WinAdmins community has a [Wiki](https://wiki.winadmins.io)! Feel free to check out some of the articles written by our community members, sharing their own experiences and knowledge.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to our Wiki, you can do so by signing in using your Discord account (you must be a member of our server in order to sign in).

Contributions can also be made by submitting a PR to the [Wiki GitHub repo](https://github.com/windows-admins/Wiki), which after being accepted and merged in, will sync back to the Wiki itself. This option is for other community members that may not be in Discord, as well as to serve as a backup.

## Guidelines

All contributions should be made via Markdown-based pages; while there are other page types available in Wiki.js, we have chosen to standardize on Markdown.
