**Microsoft 365 Apps (formerly Office 365 ProPlus) Ask Us (The Microsoft Office Rangers!) Anything!**

The first AMA with the Office Rangers was a huge success and they're coming back to answer MORE of your questions about M365 Apps and the future of M365. Come prepared with your questions because this session will be run "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) style, where the team will be available to answer all of your questions on all things Microsoft 365 Apps. If you're managing Office 365 and Office Updates in an enterprise, you cannot afford to miss this chat!
