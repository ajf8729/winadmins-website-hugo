**Breaking the Ice with Pester for PowerShell Tinkerers**

Feeling left behind as the rest of the PowerShell community dives deep into Pester? Come join [Adam Cook](https://twitter.com/codaamok) who will demonstrate in live demos how to use [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) for PowerShell. No previous experience with Pester necessary!

> Pester is a testing and mocking framework for PowerShell. Pester provides a framework for writing and running tests. Pester is most commonly used for writing unit and integration tests, but it is not limited to just that. It is also a base for tools that validate whole environments, computer deployments, database configurations and so on. ([source](https://pester.dev/docs/quick-start))

The WinAdmins team is fortunate to have Adam return to us after the success of his last event, [GitHub Actions with a Focus on PowerShell](/events/2020-10-15-getting-powershell-code-into-prod-using-github-actions-adam-cook/).
