Hello and, again, welcome to the WinAdmins monthly computer-aided patch cycle.

## Community News

We hit 5,900 members on July 28th! Hooray!

## Threads

Threads have recently been added to Discord (check out Discord's blog post [here](https://blog.discord.com/connect-the-conversation-with-threads-on-discord-3f5fa8b0f6b)). After some initial testing, we have decided to enable threads on a pilot basis, to see how they work in our community.

* All threads permissions are disabled in the `#community` channel.
	* Due to the rolling nature of discussion in the `#community` channel, we feel that threads are not needed there.
* The ability for anyone to start a new public thread has been enabled in the following channels: `#intune`, `#powershell`, `#patch-my-pc`, and `#entertainment`.
	* The above listed channels now have a 1 minute slowmode enabled to encourage the use of threads for responding to others and to keep specific topics together.
	* The `#shameless-self-promotion` and `#uservoice-discussion` channels also has public threads enabled, to allow for responses/discussion to occur about a user's post. These threads will not be impacted by the 6 hour slowmode in the channel itself.
	* All other technology-focused and off-topic channels will remain unchanged at this time.
	* These changes may be revisited in the future, please provide any feedback in the `#uservoice-discussion` channel.
* Private thread creation is disabled server-wide.
	* There is currently no need for private threads; conversations can be moved to direct messages if needed.
* Threads will automatically be archived after 24 hours of inactivity.

## Role Changes

* The `Nitro Booster` role has been moved down in ranking from above the `Microsoft Employee` and `Trusted Vendor/Organization` roles to below them, in order to highlight vendors with their role color regardless of boost status.

## Other Changes

* We've create a new repository in our GitHub organization for Intune-related items, similar to the existing ConfigMgr repository. Please feel free to contribute anything you may have found useful by submitting a pull request! https://github.com/windows-admins/Intune
* The `#get-off-my-lawn` channel has been renamed to `#home-and-garden`, per Uservoice #25.
