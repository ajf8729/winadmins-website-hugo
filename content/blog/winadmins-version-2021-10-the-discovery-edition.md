Hello and, again, welcome to the WinAdmins computer-aided patch cycle.

## 6,400 Members!

We're now up to 6,400+ members! In the words of submarine captain JÃ³hannes, "neat-o".

## Role Icons!

Discord rolled out a new feature to add icons to roles. We've added "official" icons to all of the vendor roles, as well as a few other roles. The icon displayed next to your username will be your highest role with an icon defined.

## StatBot Role!

We created a new role named "Frequent Visitor", where members will be automatically added/removed from this role as thresholds for the role are met/lost, based on statistics gathered by [StatBot](https://statbot.net/dashboard/618712310185197588/overview). This role has the same orange color as the Helper roles of the past, and was designed to make our regular members that are not vendors/MVPs/staff "stand out" a bit more.

## Server Discovery!

Discord dropped the requirements for enabling server discovery from 7,000 members to 1,000, so we're now listed as a "public" server (that "Explore Public Servers" button at the bottom of your server list). We're doing this as a trial for now; hopefully we just don't attract more folks in need of some `-techsupport`.
