Hello and, again, welcome to the WinAdmins computer-aided patch cycle.

## Discord Native Events

* Discord native events are here; please see https://dis.gd/events for more information.
* All future events that were already created in `#events` have been duplicated in the new native format.
* The `#events` channel will remain around for the meantime.
* New events will only be added via the native Discord feature.
* The `Microsoft Employee` and `Trusted Vendor/Organization` roles have been granted the "Manage Events" permission in order to add events themselves.
* You may need to reload your Discord client (Ctrl+R) in order to see the new Events section at the top of the channel list (above `#announcements`).

## Server Name Change

* The server name has been changed from "Windows Admins" to "WinAdmins".
* This is more in line with our name/representation in most other places.
* Due to this change, we no longer appear in server discovery if you search for "Windows", hopefully cutting down on joins looking for tech support.

## New/Updated Commands

* `-TechSupport` has been updated with a similar format to other custom commands, with additional links to other communities.
* `-MSFeedback` has been created, with links to the new Microsoft Feedback Portals.
* `-CMLinks` has been created, with links to useful ConfigMgr-related documentation.
